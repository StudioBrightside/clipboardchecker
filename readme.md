Clipboard checker is a set it and forget it chrome extension. It will scan and check any text you copy in your browser to determine if malicious content has been added or changed. Did the website add some text you didnâ€™t know about?

## Why do I need a clipboard checker?

Although unknown to many, JavaScript can [interact with your clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Interact_with_the_clipboard) without you noticing it. This adds for a bit of service (on the Fox News website, when you copy an excerpt, the line "Read more on Fox News..." is added), but can be harmful as well (check a â€“ harmless â€“ demo at [clipboardchecker.studiobrightside.io](https://clipboardchecker.studiobrightside.io)).

## How does it work?

- When you select a piece of text in your browser, and you copy it (either hitting âŒ˜+C/Ctrl+C or copying it from the context menu), the DOM fires a `copy` event
- A small piece of JavaScript (`/content.js`) catches this event and asks the Chrome Runtime if it can match the clipboard contents with the currently selected text (which is provided via an JavaScript API)
- The Chrome runtime (`background.js`) fetches the clipboard â€“Â by some magic from StackOverflow â€“ and matches it with the selection. If there something fishy going on, it will tell the active tab to show a popup.

## Limitations

- `document.getSelection().toString()` parses the current selection to a string, but your clipboard can typically handle rich data. This sometimes causes false positives to occur.
- To prevent the popup from firing constantly, the clipboard check is only triggered when some text has been selected. For example: turns out that password managers are manipulating your clipboard as well (seems fair when you come to think of it).

## Getting Started

This extension does not need any building/compiling to run. Mount the root of this folder as an "unpacked" extension in Google Chrome to develop.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:StudioBrightside/clipboardchecker.git
# and we're done ðŸ˜‰
```
